# Opens a Cloudflare quick tunnel to the dev server and prints the https URL,
# with a QR code so a phone can reach it without typing a random hostname.
#
#   bash scripts/tunnel.sh          # the Vite dev server on :5173
#   PORT=3000 bash scripts/tunnel.sh
#
# Why this exists: iOS refuses service workers, notifications and the installable
# PWA over plain http, so the app cannot be tested on a phone against
# http://<mac>:5173 — it needs https, and a quick tunnel is the shortest way to
# get one without a certificate or a DNS record.
#
# It points at Vite rather than the API because Vite proxies /api to :3000, so
# one tunnel covers the app and its backend. vite.config.ts already allows
# .trycloudflare.com as a host; without that the dev server refuses the request.
#
# WARNING: this publishes your local dev server on the open internet for as long
# as it runs. The hostname is random but not secret, and there is no auth in
# front of it. Stop it when you are done — Ctrl-C, or it dies with the terminal.
